# Astra_S9_FPGA
Astra_S9_FPGA is a FPGA Development Board from used Antminer S9 Control Board
is a Powerful FPGA/SoC Development Board made from a repurposed Antminer S9 Control Board.(Also works on T9+ and E3 Control Boards) It provide a cheap, powerful, efficient and versatile development environment for low-cost and is the perfect way of getting into FPGA for beginners.

I got the idea to tranform miner control board into valuable development platform a couple years ago but it stayed in the idea state for a while because i was lacking the time , but i finaly got myself time to make development more accessible for lot of hobyist that dont have the money nor want to spend hundreds and thousands of dollars to only be able to get an FPGA Board. With the price of the commercialy avaible boards like the Alinx or the Pynq platforms already high and increasing every day, and the shortage of chips and suplly chains made this project even more relevant and repurposing existing and cheap board into something comparable to those commercial paltform almost became a need.
